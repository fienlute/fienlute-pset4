A simple to-do list app that has a list of tasks that the user needs to complete. The app contains three sample to-do items that explain how the app works. If the user types text into a bottom input field and clicks an Add button, the new item will be added to the top or bottom of the list. The user is able to check off (switch on/off) and delete items. 
The todos are  saved in a SQLite database to ensure that to-do items survive when the app is killed or the phone rebooted.

I used the website https://www.sitepoint.com/managing-data-in-ios-apps-with-sqlite/ for a lot of my knowledge about how to work with SQLite and a tableview.
